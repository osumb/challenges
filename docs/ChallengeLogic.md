# Business Logic Behind The Challenge Process

## Alternates VS Regulars

Alternates in any row hold a spot number of 13, 14, or 15. Regulars are 1 - 12. Alternates don't march as much of the
performance as a regular would so as a result, need to challenge for a regular spot every week.

## Who Can Challenge Whom?

Great question! To be able to make a challenge, you must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] You're either an alternate or you're vacating the regular spot you're holding
- [ ] The person you're challenging has a regular spot
- [ ] The person you're challenging is on the same instrument and part as you
- [ ] You aren't ineligible for any reason (disciplinary, failed music check, etc)

_Note: Right now there is a distinction of part in the mellophone section, but parts  don't matter for a mellophone challenge. That might change next year though_

## Open Spots

Two people can challenge for an open spot. The rules for that are below

A spot can be vacated for 2 reasons:

### The regular holding the spot is being punished for some reason (failed music, for instance)

 In this case, we'll flag the spot as open and and person ineligible for a challenge. They are not able to make a
 selection for the upcoming performance. Their eligibility is reviewed on a weekly basis by an admin/director.


### A regular vacates his/her spot to challenge some one else

  This is where things get weird. A regular performer can vacate his/her spot in order to challenge someone else.
  Consider the following people holding the spots R13, R14, R3, and R4. Let's say that R13 is much better than R3 and
  everyone knows it. R3, knowing he'll lose, vacates his spot to try and challenge R4 for his spot. By doing this, the
  R3 spot becomes an open spot. Now R13 and R14 face each other in a challenge for the R3 spot. For outcomes can happen:

  ```
  R13 and R4 win
  Then R13 becomes R3, R3 becomes R13, and R4/R14 stay put
  ```
  ```
  R13 and R3 win
  Then R13 becomes R3, R3 becomes R4, R4 becomes R13, and R14 stays put
  ```
  ```
  R14 and R4 win
  Then R14 becomes R3, R3 becomes R14, and R4/R13 stay put
  ```
  ```
  R14 and R3 win
  Then R14 becomes R3, R3 becomes R4, R4 becomes R14, and R13 stays put
  ```

__In order for a regular to vacate his/her spot and challenge someone else, the must email a director or admin before
the challenge window opens. This is to guarantee that all alternates know that the spot is open before they make a
selection__
