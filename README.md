Application for members of the OSUMB to signup for challenges

## Installation and setup
First [download and install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

Inside your terminal, run the following commands to get the project up and running.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osumb/challenges.git
cd challenges
script/setup
```

That's it! All your dependencies are ready to go

## Start the app
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy!

### Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Staging vs Production
### Staging
The staging branch is protected just like master. To test a feature, make a pull request to this branch. We have a
staging [Heroku instance](https://osumbchallengesdev.herokuapp.com). When a PR to staging is merged, it will a trigger a
build on that instance. Give it a minute after merging as it has to go through CI again.

### Production
Working on it... Waiting for approval to get a domain to get all of that figured out
